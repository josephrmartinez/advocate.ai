[advocate.ai](https://advocateai.vercel.app/) helps people turn audio recordings of their medical appointments into searchable transcriptions. The site also scans each appointment for potential concerns or irregularities, provides automatic feedback and accountability reminders based on the doctor’s recommendations, and helps patients prepare for their upcoming medical appointments.
